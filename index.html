						<h2>Our Story</h2>
					</header>

					<p>Taylor and Shane's amazing journey began on October 29, 2011 when they were first introduced at a UCF Homecoming game tailgate hosted by Taylor's sorority and Shane's fraternity. Introduced by a mutual friend, most of the afternoon was spent playing multiple games of cornhole, all of which Taylor obviously won. After that day, moments together were only had at other social events. It wasn't until nearly a year later that Facebook messages brought them together. After a few weeks of constant messaging, Taylor gave Shane her phone number and the constant texts began along with the nightly phone calls that lasted until 3am. After hanging out a handful of times on campus, Shane asked Taylor to dinner for an official first date on September 24, 2012. Dinner turned into a spontaneous drive out to the beach where they talked and learned more about each other, all leading to Shane asking Taylor to be his girlfriend. After attempting to play hard to get and replying with "I'll have to think about it", Taylor gave into the feelings she knew she had and a few hours after he asked, she said "yes."</p>

						<h2>And then...</h2>

					<p>About three and a half years later, on April 4, 2016, Shane caught Taylor completely off guard with his marriage proposal. While completing marriage classes at their church and after a conversation with a timeline for a fall proposal, Shane took Taylor on a surprise date. Shane picked out an outfit for her and picked Taylor up to go on a picnic for a lunch date. They arrived at the botanical gardens in Winter Park, Florida and walked through the gardens to find the perfect picnic spot. When they reached a clearing, Shane set down the bag he packed with picnic supplies and pulled a Bible out from it.</p>

						<h2>The Proposal!</h2>

					<p>He then began to read 1 Corinthians 13 about what love looks like. He put the Bible back and grabbed a box out of the bag. Taylor, still having the fall proposal timeline in her head, still did not guess what was about to happen. After hearing the beautiful proposal Shane had prepared, he opened the box and got down on one knee. There were laughs and tears and an overwhelmingly easy "yes." Shane even surprised her with some unexpected guests: Taylor's mom and brother, as well as Shane's mom and sisters! <br><br>It couldn't have been more perfect if he tried.</p>
