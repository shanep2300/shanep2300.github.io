						<h2>Our Story</h2>
					</header>

					<p>Taylor and Shane's amazing journey began on October 29, 2011 when they were first introduced at a UCF Homecoming game tailgate hosted by Taylor's sorority and Shane's fraternity. Introduced by a mutual friend, most of the afternoon was spent playing multiple games of cornhole, all of which Taylor obviously won. After that day, moments together were only had at other social events. It wasn't until nearly a year later that Facebook messages brought them together. After a few weeks of constant messaging, Taylor gave Shane her phone number and the constant texts began along with the nightly phone calls that lasted until 3am. After hanging out a handful of times on campus, Shane asked Taylor to dinner for an official first date on September 24, 2012. Dinner turned into a spontaneous drive out to the beach where they talked and learned more about each other, all leading to Shane asking Taylor to be his girlfriend. After attempting to play hard to get and replying with "I'll have to think about it", Taylor gave into the feelings she knew she had and a few hours after he asked, she said "yes!"</p>

						<h2>And then...</h2>
					</header>

					<p>About three and a half years later, on April 4, 2016, Shane caught Taylor completely off guard with his marriage proposal. While completing marriage classes at their church and after a conversation with a timeline for a fall proposal, Shane took Taylor on a surprise date. Shane picked out an outfit for her and picked Taylor up to go on a picnic for a lunch date. They arrived at the botanical gardens in Winter Park, Florida and walked through the gardens to find the perfect picnic spot. When they reached a clearing, Shane set down the bag he packed with picnic supplies and pulled a Bible out from it.</p>

						<h2>The Proposal!</h2>
					</header>

					<p>He then began to read 1 Corinthians 13 about what love looks like. He put the Bible back and grabbed a box out of the bag. Taylor, still having the fall proposal timeline in her head, still did not guess what was about to happen. After hearing the beautiful proposal Shane had prepared, he opened the box and got down on one knee. There were laughs and tears and an overwhelmingly easy "yes." Shane even surprised her with some unexpected guests: Taylor's mom and brother, as well as Shane's mom and sisters! <br><br>It couldn't have been more perfect if he tried.</p>

									<h3> -- Groom's Men -- </h3>
									<p><h3>Porfirio</h3>
										Porfy is like a brother that I never had. We literally spent as much time as we could together during our high school years. He still owes me way too much gas money from the many years I drove him around, but other than that, he was always there for me when I needed him. When I moved to Orlando, because of college, we still communicated pretty much every day in the form of playing video games with each other. Our friendship as been constantly growing and am glad that he is part of my life!
									</p>

									<p><h3>Gabriel</h3>
										Angel's younger brother who used to annoy me, like a little brother would, when we were both younger. As we got older, our friendship started to change in ways that I never expected. He started looking up to me like I was his older brother. My attitude towards him drastically changed when he started asking me for life advice. If it isn't for the Atlantic Ocean separating us, we would be hanging out pretty much every day. Being on different countries has put a bit of a gap in our relationship, but that gap is closed when we're online together enojoying one of our favorite hobbies.
									</p>

									<p><h3>Mark</h3>
										If you ask them, Amanda (fianc√©e) and Mark will deny that I brought those two love birds together. Mark and I created a great friendship when we were working at Publix. He has been a better vet towards my dog then an actual doctor I spend $100+ on and our double dates have been the best that I've been on. We both enjoy gaming, board games, and solving puzzles to escape from a room! Our common interests is what makes our friendship legit.
									</p>

									<p><h3>Angel</h3>
										Oh, Angel! This is the guy that always had some new toy, game, anything to play with when we were young. Other than seeing my other important family in Puerto Rico, Angel and Gaby were the only two people I wanted to spend time with. Not only was Angel my cousin; we were great friends. I know the brother pattern has been repeated, get used to it, but Angel is the older brother I never had growing up. Things have changed now that he has an amazing girlfriend, Dora, but still to this day, when I come visit, he is still showing up with some new game that I always have to beat him in!
									</p>

									<p><h3>Thomas</h3>
										The bride's YOUNGER brother. People don't seem to get the younger part right! Out of all of my 'brothers', I'm very excited to officially call him my brother-in-law. Thomas has accepted me to his family with no problem at all. He is very easy to talk to and has one of the best personalities I have ever whitnessed. I might not pay much attention to sports, but just like the other groomsmen we do have a common interest in video games. Taylor's favorite memory of us bonding together was after meeting him for the second time, we just sat down and started playing on the PS4. We were talking to each other like we have known each other for a long time. That was the moment where I knew he was going to be an amazing friend and an awesome YOUNGER brother!
